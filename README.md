# About me: #
### I am currently in my Senior year of college persuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. Right now, I am working as a software engineering intern at a large software company. Currently, I've mainly been working on web-based projects and I have been getting very interested in frontend engineering. I am constantly trying to come up with new ideas for projects and I learn best by pushing the limits of what I am capable of. I started learning programming through making Minecraft mods in 2013 and developed a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies.  ###
