# About me: #
### I am currently in my Senior year of college pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. Right now, I am working as a full-time Software Engineer at a large software company based in Atlanta. I am constantly trying to come up with new ideas for projects and I learn best by pushing the limits of what I am capable of. 

I started learning programming through making Minecraft mods in 2013 and developed a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies.
